            >To be short, I am a Software Engineer. To be 2 words less short, I
            am a Full Stack Software Engineer. This portfolio site was created
            by me with zero framworks, just good old vanilla javascript, DOM
            manipulation, CSS, and HTML. I make things. It is what I have always
            done.</strong

          I started in created physical things, like sculpture and furniture. I
          love learning new processes to create new and interesting "things". I
          started an escape room in 2015 where I plan, build all original
          puzzles (that are then strung together to create a cohesive story and
          line of things to do for out customers). Through creating 6 fully
          functioning, hour long escape room "adventures", I began to learn
          computer science and web development. This started as a way to make a
          few intresting puzzles for my business, but then it stuck.
          <strong>I love coding.</strong>. To further my learing I applied to
          Fullstack Academy of Code, completed the program and was immediatly
          hired to become a Teaching Fellow for the next class. I loved the face
          pace learning (learning a full stack (NERDs stack) in less than three
          month and going on to create fully functioning apps. It was difficult,
          but so rewarding to leave with that wealth of knowledge I am now
          applying). Currently i am seeking full-time work as a Software
          Enineer, so please take a look at this site, my resume, and let me
          know how we can work together to build the next cool thing. Thank you.
